# Advent of Code 2018

## Day 1

Finished Part 1 within minutes. My first solution for Part 2 did not take long to figure out either, but incredibly slow.

    real    1m8.664s
    user    1m8.428s
    sys     0m0.032s

Moving on to Day 2 for now, but will definitely come back to optimize this second part.
