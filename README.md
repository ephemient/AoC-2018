# Advent of Code 2018

## Day 1

Finished Part 1 within minutes. My first solution for Part 2 did not take long to figure out either, but incredibly slow.

Moving on to Day 2 for now, but will definitely come back to optimize this second part.

## Day 2

Nothing really new here. Although, one thing I'm using this year that I didn't use last year is `break`. Never really used them before until I started playing [7 Billion Humans](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/7billionhumans).
