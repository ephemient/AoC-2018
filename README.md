# Advent of Code 2018

## Day 1

Finished Part 1 within minutes. My first solution for Part 2 did not take long to figure out either, but incredibly slow.

Moving on to Day 2 for now, but will definitely come back to optimize this second part.

After my [friend](https://github.com/ephemient) sent me [this link](https://www.reddit.com/comments/a2ajyv) a couple of minutes later...

Apparently simply changing my list to a set in Python speeds it up a lot. I learn something new everyday.

## Day 2

Nothing really new here. Although, one thing I'm using this year that I didn't use last year is `break`. Never really used them before until I started playing [7 Billion Humans](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/7billionhumans).

## Day 3

3 days worth of puzzles in one day! In general, I would like to start these puzzles at midnight when they are released unless I need to sleep early or something. It's not like I think I will ever make the leaderboard, but no harm in trying to see how fast I can compete these puzzles, right? 

I'm definitely solving these much faster than last year. Before, I always came up with the solution using the example input before using my actual puzzle input. This is because I wrote print statements after every line of code I wrote just to check that my code was actually doing what I want it to. Example input is always a lot shorter so it's easier to see when I make mistakes. Now, I have a much better understanding of what my code is doing and I can skip most of this. Only need to check when I don't get the right answer at the end. Soon, I would like to get to the point where I am writing asserts instead of print statements to check my work.
