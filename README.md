# Advent of Code 2018

## Day 1

Finished Part 1 within minutes. My first solution for Part 2 did not take long to figure out either, but incredibly slow.

Moving on to Day 2 for now, but will definitely come back to optimize this second part.

After my [friend](https://github.com/ephemient) sent me [this link](https://www.reddit.com/comments/a2ajyv) a couple of minutes later...

Apparently simply changing my list to a set in Python speeds it up a lot. I learn something new everyday.

## Day 2

Nothing really new here. Although, one thing I'm using this year that I didn't use last year is `break`. Never really used them before until I started playing [7 Billion Humans](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/7billionhumans).

## Day 3

3 days worth of puzzles in one day! In general, I would like to start these puzzles at midnight when they are released unless I need to sleep early or something. It's not like I think I will ever make the leaderboard, but no harm in trying to see how fast I can compete these puzzles, right? I'm definitely solving these much faster than last year.
